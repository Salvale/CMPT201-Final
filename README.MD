GAME OUTLINE

I want to make a slow-paced but easy to understand survival game with a focus on scavenging. The player will have to manage constantly dwindling resources as they walk down a road
towards a vague, unspecified goal. The road will be long and simple with many small digressions off the side in order to find resources. These side levels are optional but
give the player the ability to replenish resources they lose. They are also very dangerous and risk setting the player back even more. However, if the player skips all of them,
it is likely they will run out of resoures and die anyways.
